# HotelBilly

## Project Structure

To keep things simple, I made only a *src/* folder and then only put Main.java there for now, without any *package* declaration.

All methods and code will be kept inside this one java file.

## Install and Run

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeiya1/HotelBilly.git
```

2. Go inside the repository folder.

3. Run with your IDE or use this command.

```bash
java src/Main.java
```
